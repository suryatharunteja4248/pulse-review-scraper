        "review": "As a professional reviewer and someone who has spent years evaluating enterprise tools, productivity suites, CRM ecosystems and operational software, I believe in calling out gaps with clarity so organisations can make informed decisions. After a deep and objective analysis of the Zoho environment, my experience has been consistently challenging across quality, usability and reliability.Zoho attracts customers with a low entry price but once you start using the platform in real business conditions, the limitations and unexpected system behaviour become very visible.First. Calendar and email sync issues are extremely unreliable. Meeting invites created in Zoho Mail can disappear without any trace. Imagine having a million dollar meeting scheduled and it simply vanishes. No logs. No explanation.Second. Simple actions like enabling your camera for an online meeting are buried inside obscure settings. It feels less like a productivity tool and more like a treasure hunt inside a coal mine.Third. The feature that is supposed to automatically download images from trusted senders does not work consistently. You approve the sender yet the system keeps asking every time. This removes the value of the feature entirely.Fourth. Zoho Meeting is connected to Zoho Mail but the calendar does not display the meetings properly. You will find your scheduled meetings only inside Zoho Meeting while the Mail calendar remains empty. A confusing and risky experience for any business user.Fifth. Support responds quickly with tickets but the resolutions rarely solve the actual problems. Most issues continue without any meaningful fix.Sixth. The user experience across the ecosystem is poor. Important items are hidden, navigation is confusing and the overall feeling is that this is not a reliable environment to run a serious business operation.Seventh. Security configuration is unnecessarily complicated. In Google and Microsoft environments, configuration is straightforward. In Zoho, you either need a technical expert or you spend hours reading articles and chatting with support just to set up a standard security layer.There are many more functional inconsistencies that I encountered during my in depth testing. Similar behavioural issues are visible in their CRM and Desk products, so organisations should be very cautious about implementing Zoho at scale. There is a very high probability of experiencing real time glitches during business critical workflows.One of the biggest concerns is the pricing structure. It looks simple from the outside but it is designed in layers that force you into multiple subscriptions. The low initial cost disappears once you add even a basic productivity requirement.For example. Zoho Mail is cheap but it does not include documents such as spreadsheets or word processors. Once you need them, there is an add on. When you add that, you are prompted to subscribe to the drive. When you subscribe to the drive, you are encouraged to subscribe to the workspace. When you combine all these layers, the total cost reaches the same level as Google and in some cases even higher. The illusion of affordability disappears very quickly.My recommendation. Do not decide based only on low pricing. Consider long term vision, product maturity, reliability, user experience, security and organisational satisfaction. These are the factors that determine whether a tool will scale with your business or slow you down.Good luck to anyone evaluating tools for their organisation. Choose wisely and invest in platforms that prioritise performance and customer value over complexity and lock in pricing.",

In an attempt to restructure them properly, I deleted two email accounts (and all emails) from the domain and primary account, after making a backup of the emails. Only to find I couldn’t reopen them separately.I was told it was possible to recover both emails under the original primary account (on the same domain) within 7 days. I lodged a request for email recovery the next morning (day 2). By Wednesday (day 3) they had enabled me to re-add the email addresses to the primary account again, but no emails had been recovered.I again raised it with support (twice in fact). And was told it was being dealt with. I am now on day 5 (technically day 6), and still no update on the recovery of my emails. In two days, the emails will be irretrievable. And I will have lost 3 years of work emails.The backup is useless, because unbeknownst to me, the backup was created as password protected and since the account was closed I have no access to the password. Yet it never asked if I wanted to password protect the zip file.Compared to Google Workspace which we moved from, Zoho Mail feels clunky and unprofessional.",

        "review": "I signed up for Zoho Mail based on the features advertised on their pricing page, specifically CalDAV/CardDAV and ActiveSync support. These are essential for anyone needing proper email + calendar sync on desktop clients (macOS and Windows).After paying for a year up front, I discovered that although these features are listed as included, they do not work on desktop clients on the Mail Lite plan (something not disclosed anywhere on the pricing page).Zoho Support eventually confirmed in writing that desktop ActiveSync is not supported, and that only mobile devices are compatible. The CalDAV/CardDAV screen in the admin panel also lacks the configuration details required for desktop clients, making desktop calendar/contact sync impossible. This is a material omission and renders the plan unusable for its advertised purpose.I requested a refund immediately. Support instructed me to cancel the plan and contact the cancellation team, which I did. I have since received no response at all, despite multiple follow-ups.At this point, I am preparing to initiate a chargeback with my bank due to the service being sold with misleading feature information and the lack of any substantive response from Zoho’s cancellation department.I strongly advise potential customers to verify in writing that the features you need actually work on the plan you are considering.

        "review": "Our organization recently trialed the Zoho Social service as we're looking to simplify management of our social media channels, allowing easy scheduling and improving our team's workflow.Our initial impressions have been very positive overall. The analytics are very detailed and useful and there a a ton of great features. It's prices a little higher than other competing products we've looked at but it also seems to be the most complete and fully featured too.The good:1. Scheduling works great and posts always went live at the correct scheduled time.2. Being able to see exactly how many characters remain when writing a post for Twitter and Bluesky is a great help!3. The dashboard gives a great overview of the brand and the in-depth analytics are very thorough and useful to analyzer how all our social accounts are performing.4. Being able to easily view and handle various follower interactions is another highly useful feature. It's very convenient to get engagement notifications from all social accounts all in one place, as well as being able to also respond to any replies or messages as needed.5. The ability to collaborate with our entire team and setup approval workflows is another great feature. It can cost quite a lot extra to add this compared to competing services, also depending on the number of team members, but for smaller teams it's great.What could be improved:1. Whilst at first it appears that Telegram is supported to some extent, this is only for bot interactions. Zoho Social does not support posting messages in Telegram groups or channels. Support for scheduling posts in Telegram channels would have been a great feature to add, although also very few alternatives actually appear to actually support this (we could only find a single one that even claims to have support for this).2. Whilst the interface for making new posts is nice and easy to use, the option to create threads (for Twitter and Bluesky) seems like a bit of an afterthought. It's not as polished as the rest of the interface and the post preview doesn't show any additional posts in the thread, only the first one. Finally, scheduling threads will treat each service (Twitter, Bluesky) as a separate independent post instead of linking the services into a single post; this is a minor issue but effectively means that deleting or rescheduling a thread means you have to change it individually for each service instead of just once like you would normally do with a single-post message.3. Permission roles, whilst adequate, do have a few quirks. It's not possible to customize the default roles to e.g. disallow access to the analytics or Inbox views and it's not possible to give any special permissions to custom roles (e.g. admin permissions, ability to add/remove users). This means that you're forced to use the default admin roles to give users this ability, but you then cannot limit which admin permissions they get or what they can access.4. Certain settings can only be set on the user level and don't apply to all users within a brand, mainly the automatic URL shortening feature. Our organization already generate our own custom short URLs that we use and we currently would have to instruct each team member to disable the automatic URL shortening on their account as it's not possible to disable this globally for all users.",

        "review": "I have never had such a disappointing experience with a service provider as I have had with Zoho. What began as a promising platform quickly turned into one of the most frustrating and time-consuming IT experiences I’ve ever dealt with.From the very beginning, there were persistent syncing issues across my email accounts. Emails would regularly take anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes to appear in my inbox, and sometimes they wouldn’t come through at all until I manually refreshed or signed out and back in again. This wasn’t an isolated problem — it was a daily occurrence, and it severely affected communication with clients and colleagues. For a business platform that markets itself as reliable and professional, these delays were unacceptable.I contacted support multiple times over several months to try and get this resolved. Unfortunately, every interaction left me more frustrated. The support process is painfully slow and disjointed — you wait days for an initial response, only to be passed between different agents who don’t seem to read the previous correspondence or understand the issue. When someone finally offers to connect remotely to your computer, the experience is far from reassuring. It often feels like the technicians are guessing at solutions, trying different settings and configurations at random, rather than providing a clear, structured fix. You’re essentially watching them stab in the dark, hoping something might work.On several occasions, these interventions actually made things worse — for example, triggering password resets or account access problems that forced me to change my password multiple times for no clear reason. There is very little confidence in their technical understanding, and the overall experience feels like trial and error rather than professional IT support.After months of ongoing issues and wasted time, I finally made the decision to move all of my services to Microsoft, which immediately resolved the problems I had been facing with Zoho. Unfortunately, things went from bad to worse when it came to billing and account management.Despite my clear request to close the account and stop all services, Zoho went ahead and took funds from my account without authorization. When I contacted them about this, rather than acknowledging the mistake, they shifted the blame onto me, claiming I hadn’t cancelled “properly” through my account portal — even though I had explicitly instructed them to cancel in writing. Their response was dismissive and unhelpful: they refused to issue a refund and instead offered to extend a service I no longer required for an additional 12 months.In my view, that is completely unacceptable business practice. Taking money without permission and then refusing to refund it, especially when the service was not used and had been requested to be cancelled, is indefensible.The combination of unreliable systems, poor technical knowledge, slow response times, and a refusal to take accountability for errors paints a very clear picture of a company that is not customer-focused and lacks professionalism.I would strongly caution any business considering Zoho to think very carefully before committing. My experience has been one of constant technical issues, wasted hours on support, and an eventual financial dispute that was handled with little regard for fairness or customer service.Switching away from Zoho to a more stable platform was the best decision I made, but the time and money lost dealing with them is something I won’t get back. Based on my experience, I would not recommend Zoho to any business that values reliability, transparency, or proper customer care.The update: they emailed 12/11/2025 (Pratap) to say they will look into my review and get back to me within 48 hours. 6 days later no further communication has been received. This really sums up my dealings with them - Be warned stay away and save yourself the hassle.",

After extensive comparison, Zoho Social clearly stands out as the most intuitive, operationally efficient, and insight-rich solution in the market.The platform delivers an exceptional user experience — from scheduling content across channels to monitoring engagement and analysing performance. The interface is clean, the workflows are seamless, and the analytics dashboard provides the right level of granularity for data-driven decision-making. For someone in a high-paced industry like mortgage broking, this level of clarity and control is invaluable.What impressed me the most is the platform’s ability to simplify everything. No clutter. No complexity. Just a robust, well-designed tool that empowers you to execute, measure, and optimise your social media strategy with confidence.If you are a business owner seeking a hassle-free, scalable, and genuinely effective social media management platform, look no further than Zoho Social.

Let's test my French:UN: Because they don't want complaints over spamming...yes, and yet to get business you need to make business.Kind of obvious. Think I just thought up a perfect equation.And DUH:Because no-one spam-filters your email-address just because  it has 'help' or 'info' or 'media' or whatever at the beginning of your email-address - they class some prefixes as 'Groups' and further disallow them. Mmm. Welcome to Planet Zoho.No. Spam email-address are judged as such going by the ends of emails, not prefixes, or at least it's this way in 2025. Even then, businesses and organisations are always forming their email-addresses with inapplicable endings, e.g. .org should technically be for 'org...anisations'...while I can tell you that many companies and organisations use other domain-extensions than what they technically should.So, they're doing themselves out of business by turning away companies in requirement of clients and a large portion of clients which have been obtained by companies.Utterly ridiculous and somewhat stupid.

The website is pointless without paying for it. Use a more seamless website that at least respects their customers by offering ANY features (what you have already scheduled at least on the free tier) incase your repayments fail one month and your whole scheduling for your social media empire dies in a day.

Many of these messages violate EU and GDPR laws, with no functioning opt-out, no sender transparency, and fake company identities. It’s a digital free-for-all of fraudsters using Zoho’s services as a launchpad.What makes it worse is Zoho’s complete refusal to take accountability. I’ve reported the issue directly to their support, abuse and privacy teams multiple times, provided full headers, and cited clear violations of anti-spam regulations. The response? Not their problem.It’s one thing for a company to have a few bad actors on their platform. It’s another to harbor them, profit from their traffic, and ignore victims who are simply asking not to be targeted.If you value your privacy, data integrity, and inbox sanity — avoid Zoho like the plague.

You can’t pay for the product that worked perfectly, and now you have to rebuild your entire billing workflow to fit the new API.Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.",

At least once a week, Zoho becomes so slow that it’s practically unusable. All other software packages we use work fine, so it’s definitely a Zoho problem. This isn't just an inconvenience, we run a customer-facing shop, and when Zoho is down or so slow it does not load anything, we can’t serve our clients. We’ve had to turn away customers simply because we couldn’t access the tools we rely on. That has already cost us multiple clients and damaged our reputation. What makes it worse is the complete lack of support. We’ve reached out for help multiple times, but we get no response. No acknowledgment, no follow-up, nothing. Just automated email how you rate the support White no support is given. Zoho was great and they did have a good support, but those times have been long gone. If you're considering Zoho for your business in 2025, think very carefully about the risk you're taking. It’s simply unusably slow 1 or 2 days per week, nothing is being done to solve it yet, and there is 0 support from Zoho, except for automated messages that don’t help with anything.",

        "review": "It all started with a simple decision: I wanted to cancel my Zoho Books subscription. The software wasn’t meeting my small business’s needs, and I figured it would be a straightforward process. I’d heard of companies making cancellations tricky, but I never imagined the ordeal I was about to face.I reached out to Zoho’s customer support through their chat system, expecting a quick resolution. The representative was polite but unhelpful, directing me to a set of instructions on their website to cancel my subscription. They sent me a link to a help page titled “How to Cancel Your Zoho Books Subscription.” Hopeful, I clicked through, only to find a maze of FAQs and settings menus with no clear “Cancel Subscription” button. The steps described a link that simply didn’t exist. I double-checked, refreshed, and even tried different browsers, but it was nowhere to be found.Frustrated, I contacted support again. This time, I was told they couldn’t cancel it from their end and that I had to follow the website’s process. I explained the missing link, but they insisted it was there and suggested I clear my cache or try another device. I did both—still nothing. Hours turned into days as I emailed back and forth, each response from Zoho pointing me to the same nonexistent link. It felt like a deliberate runaround, as if they were banking on me giving up.Meanwhile, my credit card was charged again for another month. I realized I couldn’t trust Zoho to handle this fairly. Desperate, I called my bank and explained the situation. They flagged the charges as unauthorized and advised me to cancel my credit card to prevent further charges. It was a hassle—changing my card meant updating all my other subscriptions and payments—but it was the only way to stop Zoho from taking my money.In the end, I got a new card, and the charges stopped. But the experience left me angry and betrayed. Zoho’s refusal to assist and their broken cancellation process cost me time, stress, and money. I’m sharing this story to warn others: be cautious with Zoho Books. Never give them your credit card details unless you’re prepared to fight to get them back. If you’re considering their service, think twice—there are other accounting tools out there that don’t trap you in a cycle of frustration.",
